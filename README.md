# MapBanTool
Tool for FaceIt Overwatch map banning  <br />
To use:  <br />
        - write the maps you want to get data from in mappool.txt with a line break after each map (Case Sensitive)<br />
        - click MapBanTool  <br />
        - paste in the id to a team ex: https://www.faceit.com/en/teams/a48a7ac2-a3d7-4817-938b-f9f16e374e97/leagues <br />
        - the id would be a48a7ac2-a3d7-4817-938b-f9f16e374e97 <br />

        - open output_files to get the data  <br />
  
Only files that should be edited are mappool.txt
You can move files out of output_files but do not delete the folder
You can move MapBanTool out of the folder and it should still work fine
